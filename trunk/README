NES.app
NES Emulator for iPhone
Version 0.11

Core: InfoNES Project ( based on pNesX ) 
Code: stepwhite, nervegas
Cool: nightwatch (CoreSurfaces), bwhiteman (CoreAudio)

BUILDING

Compile using 'make'. You will need the arm-apple-darwn toolchain. See:
	http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/Toolchain_Project

This will create a new NES.app package in ./build. 

Upload entire NES.app directory into /Applications folder on iPhone and reboot
the iPhone. It should automatically detect the application and add it to the
springboard.

NOTE ON SOUND
Sound required that you disable mediaserverd, and only works through the 
headphones. A couple of easy aliases can be added to your .profile to disable or
re-enable mediaserverd if you are using MobileShell:

alias nosound="/bin/launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/coreaudiod.plist"
alias sound="/bin/launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/coreaudiod.plist"

It's buggy, but it works! Watch for improvements in future releases.
