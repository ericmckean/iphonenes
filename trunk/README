COMPILING FROM SOURCE

0. You will need to install the arm-apple-darwin toolchain. See:
   http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/Toolchain_Project
 
   You will also need to apply the patches in toolchain-includes-patch.txt
   Run the patch in your toolchain's include directory. For example:

       cd /usr/local/arm-apple-darwin/include
       patch -p0 < toolchain-includs-patch.txt

1. Compile using 'make'. This will create a new NES.app package in ./build. 

   Upload entire NES.app directory into /Applications on the iPhone and reboot
   the iPhone. It should automatically detect the application and add it to the
   springboard. 

2. Place your ROM files in /var/root/Media/ROMs/NES

KNOWN ISSUES

  SOUND
  In order to have sound, you must disable mediaserverd, which is the iPhone's
  sound mixer process, which is locked onto the audio device.  A couple of 
  easy aliases can be added to your .profile to disable or re-enable 
  mediaserverd if you are using MobileShell:

 alias nosound="launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/coreaudiod.plist"
 alias sound="launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/coreaudiod.plist"

  While you have mediaserverd disabled ('nosound'), no other system sounds
  will play, so be sure to re-enable it ('sound') when you're finished playing. 

  MULTITOUCH
  The multitouch reports mouseDown and mouseDragged events separately, and so
  you can run while holding 'B', for example, but the iPhone appears to get
  pushed to the limits when you are holding a direction and dragging on
  another. It fails to report the necessary mouseUp events to distinguish which
  button(s) let up, and so they must all be reset. 

  As a result, if you are doing something complex, such as running with B held
  down, then jump with A, you will also need to slide your thumb back off the
  directional pad (to zero, or to the other size) to stop running as that
  mouseUp will not be reported.

  VOLUME

  If you disable mediaserverd with the earbuds connected, no audio will be heard
  through the speakers. Pull the earbuds out, and then start/stop mediaserverd
  again. This will correct the problem. If it doesn't, try resetting.

  It is recommended you always kill mediaserverd with the earbuds DISCONNECTED
  to have both speaker and earbud support. If, however, you would like much
  louder ear buds (and no speaker), resetting it with the earbuds in will
  have this effect.

  SAVE STATE

  NES.app automatically saves the state of your game when you leave the game.
  You can choose to start a fresh game from the "All Games" menu, or tap 
  "Saved Games" and load your previously saved game. This feature is 
  still somewhat buggy, and some games restore with a temporarily mangled 
  character table, until you proceed to a new screen where they are re-loaded.

DEBUG

  Debugging writes debugging output to /tmp/NES.debug

  Debug also causes the hotspots on the screen to be drawn in vivid colors, for
  debugging the controls.
