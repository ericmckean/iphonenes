NES.app
NES Emulator for iPhone
Version 0.16

Core: InfoNES Project ( based on pNesX ) 
Code: stepwhite, nervegas
Cool: nightwatch (CoreSurfaces), bwhiteman (CoreAudio)

BUILDING

0. You will need to install the arm-apple-darwin toolchain. See:
   http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/Toolchain_Project
 
   You will also need to apply the patches in toolchain-includes-patch.txt
   Depending on where you've installed your includes, you may need to
   modify this file, or provide filenames at patch time. Use like this:

   patch -p0 < toolchain-includes-patch.txt

1. The default compile mode is 'portrait' mode. If you prefer to build a
   landscape version, edit Makefile and uncomment this line:

   #CFLAGS = -DLANDSCAPE

2. Compile using 'make'. This will create a new NES.app package in ./build. 

   Upload entire NES.app directory into /Applications on the iPhone and reboot
   the iPhone. It should automatically detect the application and add it to the
   springboard. 

3. Place your ROM files in /var/root/Media/ROMs/NES

NOTE ON SOUND
Sound required that you disable mediaserverd, and only works through the 
headphones. A couple of easy aliases can be added to your .profile to disable or
re-enable mediaserverd if you are using MobileShell:

alias \
nosound="/bin/launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/coreaudiod.plist"

alias \
sound="/bin/launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/coreaudiod.plist"

NOTE ON MULTITOUCH
The multitouch reports mouseDown and mouseDragged events separately, and so
you can run while holding 'B', for example, but the iPhone appears to get
confused about the mouseUp event, and does not report the correct mouseUp.
For this reason, whenever you are holding a direction + button, releasing
the button will cause the direction to stop moving as well. I am working on
finding a way to poll the screen to re-evaluate all the buttons, but until
then, this is the only caveat you'll have to live with.
